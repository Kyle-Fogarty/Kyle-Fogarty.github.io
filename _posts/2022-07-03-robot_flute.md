We present the first open source hardware (OSH) design and build of an automated robotic internal duct flute player, including an artificial lung and pitch calibration system. Using a recorder as an introductory instrument, the system is designed to be as modular as possible, enabling modification to fit further instruments across the woodwind family. Design considerations include the need to be as open to modification and accessible to as many people and instruments as possible. The system is split into two physical modules: a blowing module and a fingering module, and three software modules: actuator control, pitch calibration and musical note processing via MIDI. The system is able to perform beginner level recorder player melodies.
