I am a first year PhD student, supervised by Dr Cengiz Ã–ztireli. My research spans computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. I seek to enable the easy creation, manipulation, visualisation, and analysis of high-fidelity digital models of reality, with a specific emphasis on the modelling of natural structures. My PhD is funded by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Agri-Food Robotics: <u><a href ="https://agriforwards-cdt.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk">AgriFoRwArdS</a></u>.

Before coming to Cambridge, I studied for an integrated masters degree in Mathematics and Physics (MMath&Phys) at the Univeristy of Manchester and a masters degree (MSc) in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the University of Lincoln.
